Grace and the Beatitudes

PRESENTER’S GUIDE

AIM

To know the meaning of ‘grace’ and how the Beatitudes surpass natural human perfection.

Presentation Part 1: What is Grace?

From the definition of grace (second slide), ask the participants what the term ‘supernatural’ means. Point out that to be supernatural in the theological sense is not something weird or spooky, but refers to an elevation of nature that enables divine friendship with God, something that we could not enjoy by unaided human nature alone (see overleaf). Ask participants why an image of Baptism appears in these slides.
The answer is in Baptism we are ‘born from above,’ receiving the supernatural life of grace.

Traditional terms for the supernatural life

Ask why the image of the Virgin Mary appears in these slides.
The answer is that Mary was declared to be ‘full of grace,’ and her life expresses perfectly what we mean by the life of grace. Ask what they think of traditional terms for the supernatural life (second slide), such as becoming ‘partakers of the divine nature.’ What they should notice is that these and other phrases, like becoming ‘co-heirs of Christ’ or ‘temples of the Holy Spirit,’ are extremely exalted. The implication of such exalted language is that the life of grace is not a trivial gift, but a sharing in God’s own life in loving union with God. The saints, who enjoy the fruition of this life, are adopted children of God in glory.

The life of grace

Point out that the life of grace, which begins in Baptism, has its proper growth and goal (third slide). The maturing of the life of grace, in other words, the cultivation of saints, is often a gradual rather than an instantaneous process in this life, nourished by the sacraments, prayer, and the Church.

The theological virtues

Explain that angels on the left of this image may represent the essential virtues of the life of grace: faith, hope, and charity. The greatest of these virtues is charity, the theological meaning of which is the supernatural love of God. Ask them what they think love means. The answer is that love has two indispensable elements: the desire for the good of the other and the desire for union with the other. So by the theological virtue of charity, we desire the union of friendship with God and we desire to do God’s will.

Mistakes regarding grace

See the first question overleaf for clarification of these mistakes.

Presentation Part 2: What are the Beatitudes?

What are the Beatitudes?

If there is time, read Matthew 5:3-11 at the start of this section.

Beatitudes of holy detachment

Ask why a person with the beatitude of poverty of spirit might surrender all the goods of this world joyfully. The answer is not that the goods of this world are evil in themselves. The joy comes from a consciousness of what one has received, the gift of grace, in comparison with which all the goods of this world become pale and empty, except insofar as they pertain to this loving union with God.

Beatitudes of the active life

Point out that the ‘active life’ in the sense of these three beatitudes is less about action in the conventional sense and more about sacrifice and a yearning of the heart for those in need.

Beatitudes of the contemplative life

Point out that these are the culminating beatitudes: purity of heart refers to the internal perfection of the soul; peacemaking refers to a harmony of the soul with the saints.

The Beatitude of persecution for Christ

Ask them if they can think of examples of Christians being persecuted. Point out that Christians have experienced persecution of various kinds more or less continuously since Biblical times, as Jesus foretold:

"Because you are not of the world... therefore the world hates you" (John 15:19).

Questions on Grace and the Beatitudes

QUESTION: Since grace is invisible, how do we know grace is real?

Grace is a quality of the soul and, like all qualities of the soul, grace is not directly visible to us. Such qualities can, however, be known from their effects on the way a person lives. Now, the effects of grace are very diverse, shown by the remarkable variety of the saints. Nevertheless, there are certain general characteristics of a mature life of grace.

First, one’s stance towards other human beings changes, since, as an adopted child of God, all other living human beings become one’s brothers and sisters, at least potentially. Second, one’s stance towards the world changes. Many things that are often seen as important, such as material possessions, become trivial in themselves. Conversely, many things that seem trivial to other people, such as small actions done with great love, take on eternal significance. Therefore, although mature Christians rarely withdraw from the world in a physical way, they are different, and are often seen as different by their contemporaries.

"Their days are passed on the earth, though their citizenship is above in the heavens" (Epistle to Diognetus, 5:9).

So although grace is not directly seen, the effects of grace can be perceived in the lives of those who show its fruits.

QUESTION: In what way is human nature lacking that we also need grace?

Human nature has the ability to discover that there is a God, but it is only by grace that we can know God personally as His adopted children. Hence one of the prayers that are unique to Christianity is the Our Father, which is addressed not to a distant god, but to a loving Father by those born into the life of grace.

There are various standard mistakes about the relationship between nature and grace. Pelagianism implies that nature alone is sufficient for us to achieve Christian perfection. Determinism is a distorted view of grace, implying grace entirely overrides nature, so that human choices have no bearing on salvation. Modernism takes many forms but essentially dissolves the distinction between nature and grace entirely.

QUESTION: If Christians have grace, why do so many Christians seem much like everyone else?

Many persons who have received Baptism and become Christians subsequently lose grace through mortal sin. Until the restoration of grace, usually through the sacrament of Confession, such persons are like dead branches and cannot bear the fruits of grace. Many other Christians live a kind of dull life. They remain occupied, at least in part, by the search for happiness in this passing world.

Jesus described this condition as being like seed thrown among thorns, where the seed is the word of God and the thorns are the cares of the world and the delight in riches. These thorns choke the life of grace, and it proves unfruitful (Matthew 13:22).

Nevertheless, the relatively few Christians who surrender to God’s grace with a full heart can quite rapidly show the fruits of this grace in radically transformed lives, lives that are manifestly unlike those of most people. Grace, for example, St. Francis of Assisi, who was from a prosperous family, gave up all his possessions, and the fire of divine love that burned in his heart is still spreading throughout the world today.

QUESTION: Don’t the states called ‘blessed’ in the Beatitudes – especially poverty, mourning, meekness, hunger, thirst, and persecution – seem a curse rather than a blessing?

Some of the conditions praised in the Beatitudes might seem like a curse taken in isolation, but they can be blessed in the context of knowing God, in comparison to whom other goods become pale and empty. St. Paul, for instance, says that he has suffered the loss of ‘all things.’ Yet he adds that he counts such things as worthless refuse in comparison to the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus the Lord (Philippians 3:8).
